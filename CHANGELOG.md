All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.33.0] – 2022-05-02

### New 

- `allow_partial` flag in all `abi.decode_*` functions. This flag controls decoder behaviour whether return error or not in case of incomplete BOC decoding
- `REMP` supported. `ProcessingEvent` enum is extended with `REMP` statuses (enum of events posted into `processing.wait_for_transaction` function callback )
- UNSTABLE. `first_remp_status_timeout` and `next_remp_status_timeout` parameters in network config

## [1.32.0] – 2022-03-22

### New 

- `network.queries_protocol` config parameter allows selecting protocol the SDK uses to communicaite with GraphQL endpoint:
  - `HTTP` – SDK performs single HTTP-request for each request.
  - `WS` – SDK uses single WebSocket connection to send all requests. This protocol is a preferable
    way when the application sends many GraphQL requests in parallel. 

### Fixed
- **Debot module**:
    - If DEngine received a non-zero exit_code while emulating a transaction while sending a message, DEngine will call onErrorId callback of the message.

## [1.31.0] – 2022-03-09

### New 
**crypto module:**
- `Cryptobox` introduced: root crypto object that stores encrypted secret and acts as a factory for all crypto primitives used in SDK. 
  Crypto box provides signing and encryption boxes.

  Functions:  
  [`create_crypto_box`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_crypto.md#create_crypto_box) - initializes cryptobox with secret   
  [`remove_crypto_box`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_crypto.md#remove_crypto_box) - removes cryptobox and overwrites all secrets with zeroes  
  [`get_crypto_box_seed_phrase`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_crypto.md#get_crypto_box_seed_phrase) - returns decrypted seed phrase  
  [`get_crypto_box_info`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_crypto.md#get_crypto_box_info) - returns encrypted cryptobox secret for next cryptobox initializations  
  [`get_signing_box_from_crypto_box`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_crypto.md#get_signing_box_from_crypto_box) - derives signing box from secret  
  [`get_encryption_box_from_crypto_box`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_crypto.md#get_encryption_box_from_crypto_box) - derives encryption box from secret  
  [`clear_crypto_box_secret_cache`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_crypto.md#clear_crypto_box_secret_cache) - forces secret cache (signing and encryption) clean up (overwrites all secrets with zeroes). 


### Fixed
- Documentation generator for app object interface fills documentation from
  `ParamsOfXXXAppObject` enum.
- Documentation generator for function with `obj` parameter add this parameter 
  into parameters section with link to appropriate AppObject interface.  

## [1.30.2] – 2022-03-14

- **Debot module**:
    - Аdded float numbers support for Json interface
- Added guide for custom giver usage.

### Fixed

### Fixed
- Empty `function_name` field in the "create run message failed" error.

## [1.27.0] – 2021-12-03

### New
- Function [`abi.encode_initial_data`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_abi.md#encode_initial_data) which
  encodes initial account data with initial values for the contract's static variables and owner's public key. 
  This function is analogue of `tvm.buildDataInit` function in Solidity.

### Fixed
- Subscription for Counterparties failed with 'Unknown type "CounterpartieFilter"' error. 

## [1.26.1] – 2021-12-01

### Fixed
- Fixed building and warning.

## [1.26.0] – 2021-11-25

### New
- **Debot module**:
    - Аdded `allow_no_signature` parameter to `decode_and_fix_ext_msg()` and 
      `onerror_id` return value to `prepare_ext_in_message()` inner functions used in TS4.
    - Added support for async external calls.
    - `Query` interface extended with `waitForCollection` and `query` methods. `waitForCollection` allows to wait
     for completion of async external calls.
    - Added support for DeBots with ABI 2.2.
- Function [`proofs.proof_message_data`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/reference/types-and-methods/mod_proofs.md#proof_message_data) which proves message data, retrieved 
  from Graphql API.

## [1.25.0] – 2021-11-08

### New
- Added JS Blob support in lib-web
- New module [`proofs`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_proofs.md) is introduced!  
- Functions [`proofs.proof_block_data`](./docs/mod_proofs.md#proof_block_data) and [`proofs.proof_transaction_data`](./docs/mod_proofs.md#proof_transaction_data) 
  which prove block data, retrieved from Graphql API. 
  
  These are the first functions from proofs series :) Wait for others(`proof_account_data`, `proof_message_data`) in the next releases. 

  Read about them more in the [documentation](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_proofs.md#proof_block_data). 

- [`abi.decode_boc`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_abi.md#decode_boc) function to decode custom BOC data into JSON parameters.
- `Ref(<ParamType>)` type was added to ABI.   
  Solidity functions use ABI types for builder encoding. The simplest way to decode such a BOC is to use ABI decoding. ABI has it own rules for fields layout in cells so manually encoded BOC can not be described in terms of ABI rules. To solve this problem we introduce a new ABI type `Ref(<ParamType>)` which allows to store `ParamType` ABI parameter in cell reference and, thus, decode manually encoded BOCs. This type is available only in `decode_boc` function and will not be available in ABI messages encoding until it is included into some ABI revision.

## [1.24.0] – 2021-10-18

### New
- `boc.get_boc_depth` function to get depth of the provided boc.
- `boc.decode_tvc` function returns additional fields `code_hash`, `code_depth`, `data_hash`, `data_depth` and `compiler_version`

- **Debot module**:
    - added `parse` function to Json interface.

## [1.23.0] – 2021-10-05

### New
- `boc.get_code_salt` and `boc.set_code_salt` functions for contract code salt management.
- `boc.encode_tvc` and `boc.decode_tvc` functions for TVC image encoding and decoding
- `boc.get_compiler_version` function extracting compiler version from contract code
- `abi.update_initial_data` and `abi.decode_initial_data` function for pre-deployment contract data management

## [1.22.0] – 2021-09-20

### New
- ABI v2.2 with fixed message body layout supported. [See the specification](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-abi/blob/master/docs/ABI_2.2_spec.md).

  Now, for contracts with ABI version < 2.2  compact layout will still be used for compatibility, for contracts with ABI version 2.2 and more - fixed layout will be used.  
**Please, make sure that you updated the ABI if you recompiled your contract with 2.2 ABI, or you may get an inconsistent contract behaviour**.
- **Debot module**:
    - added `getEncryptionBoxInfo`, `getSigningBoxInfo` functions to Sdk interface.
    - implemented Query DeBot interface in DEngine.

## [1.21.5] – 2021-09-13

### Fixed
- `abi.encode_message` and `processing.process_message` created invalid deploy message in case of
`Signer::None` was used, and contract could not be deployed.
- lib-node's bridge crashed on `client.close`.

## [1.21.4] – 2021-09-08

### New
- Support MacOS aarch64 target

## [1.21.3] – 2021-09-02

### New
- Information about used endpoint is added to subscription errors.
- Graphql response error codes 500-599 are treated as retriable network errors

## [1.21.2] – 2021-08-25

### Fixed
- Updated crypto libraries in order to fix building.

## [1.21.1] – 2021-08-24

### Fixed
- http errors were not processed as network errors and didn't lead to endpoint reconnect and request retry

## [1.21.0] – 2021-08-18

### New
- `crypto.create_encryption_box` function for creating SDK-defined encryption boxes. First supported 
algorithm - AES with CBC mode.
- **Debot module**:
    - Аdded public `prepare_ext_in_message` function.

### Fixed
- `tvm.run_executor` did not work when SDK is configured to use TONOS SE, because of incomplete default
blockchain configuration. Now mainnet config from key block 10660619 (last key block at the moment of fix)
is used as default.

## [1.20.1] – 2021-07-30
### Fixed
- `RuntimeError: unreachable`  in wasm

## [1.20.0] – 2021-07-16

### New
- ABI version `2.1` supported.
- Now all requests to GraphQL are limited with timeout to react on unexpected server unavailability.
Existing timeouts in waiting functions keep the same behaviour. All other requests timeout now can 
be set with `net.query_timeout` config parameter. Its default value is 60000 ms
- **Debot module**:
    - added `encrypt`, `decrypt` functions to Sdk interface which accept encryption box handles.

### Fixed
- Deployment with empty signer in cases of public key set in TVC or deploy set.

### New
- `get_address_type` function in `utils` module, which validates address and returns its type. See the documentation.
- `decode_account_data` function in `abi` module that converts account data BOC into JSON representation according to ABI 2.1. See the documentation.
- Diagnostic fields `filter` and `timestamp` added to `wait_for_collection` error
- `main.ton.dev` and `net.ton.dev` endpoints that will be deprecated on 12.07.21 are now replaced with [proper endpoints list](https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/85c869-networks), if they were specified in network `endpoints` config 

### Fixed
- Search of the first master blocks during the network start period was fixed in blocks and transactions iterators

## [1.18.1] – 2021-07-01

### Improved

- Improved error messages regarding Union-typed parameters (e.g. `abi` and `signer` in `encode_message`): helper functions (e.g. `signerNone`, `signerKeys`, etc.) are suggested if applicable.

## [1.18.0] – 2021-06-26

### New
- Iterators in `net` module: robust way to iterate blockchain items (blocks, transactions) 
  in specified range. See documentation for `create_block_iterator` , `create_transaction_iterator`, 
  `resume_block_iterator`, `resume_transaction_iterator`, `iterator_next`, `iterator_remove` 
  functions.
- Library adds `http://` protocol to endpoints `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0` if protocol 
  isn't specified in config.
- **Debot module**:
    - added tests for Json interface.
## [1.17.0] – 2021-06-21

### New
- Added support of external encryption boxes. [See the documentation](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_crypto.md#register_encryption_box)
- **Debot module**:
    - Dengine waits for completion of all transactions in a chain initiated by debot's onchain call.

## [1.16.1] – 2021-06-16

### New
- `timeout` option to `query_transaction_tree` – timeout used to limit waiting time for the next 
  message and transaction in the transaction tree.
  
### Improved

- Improved error messages regarding ABI and JSON interface. SDK now shows additional tips for the user in cases of 
  errors.

### Fixed
- Warnings in Rust 1.52+. Little fixes in the documentation.
- `total_output` field in fees was always 0.
- `query_transaction_tree` didn't wait for messages.

## [1.16.0] – 2021-05-25

### New

- `query_transaction_tree` function that returns messages and transactions tree produced 
  by the specified message was added to `net` module. [See the documentation](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/1.16.0/docs/mod_net.md#query_transaction_tree)
- `libOptions.loadModule` – ability to specify alternative WASM module loader. 

### Fixed

- `AbiData.key` type changed to u32.
- attempt to use `orderBy` instead of `order` in `query_collection` will raise error.

## [1.15.0] – 2021-05-18

### New

- Sync latency detection increases connection reliability. Library will change the current endpoint 
  when it detects data sync latency on it.
  
- Configuration parameters: `latency_detection_interval`, 
  `max_latency`. See client documentation for details. 

- **Debot module**:
    - signing messages with signing box handles returned from debots.
    - return any sdk errors to debot in case of external calls.
    - defining signing box handle used to sign message in approve callback.

## [1.14.2] – 2021-04-30

### Fixed

- Typo in lib-react-native install script

## [1.14.1] – 2021-04-28

### Fixed

- **Debot module**:
    - DebotInfo field `key` renamed to `caption`

## [1.14.0] – 2021-04-28

### New

- **Debot module**:
    - implementation of Network DeBot interface in DEngine.
    - implementation of `signHash` function in Sdk interface.

### Fixed

- **Debot module**:
    - fixed bug in Json interface with supporting nested structures and arrays of structures.
    - fixed bug in Json interface with keys containing hyphens.

## [1.13.0] – 2021-04-23

### New
- Refined bridging model in `core` package. Library introduces new interface BinaryBridge. 
  Bridge authors can implement this interface instead of BinaryLibrary to 
  get more precise control over bridging.
  For example it makes possible to use separated response handlers for different 
  requests.
  
- [`net.query_counterparties`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_net.md#query_counterparties) - allows to query and paginate through the list of accounts that the specified account 
 has interacted with, sorted by the time of the last internal message between accounts.   
  Subscription to counterparties collection is available via `net.subscribe_collection` function.

- Blockchain interaction reliability improvement (broadcast): library sends external inbound messages simultaneously 
  to the N randomly chosen endpoints. If all N endpoints failed to responce then library repeats 
  sending to another random N endpoints (except the failed one). 
  If all the available endpoints fail to respond then library throws error.
  The N parameter is taken from `config.network.sending_endpoint_count` (default is 2).

- Blockchain interaction reliability improvement (bad delivery list): library tracks endpoints 
  with bad message delivery (expired messages). These endpoints have lower priority when library chooses endpoints 
  to send message.
  
- **Debot module**:
    - Implementation of `Json` DeBot interface in DEngine.

## [1.12.0] – 2021-04-01

### New
- [`utils.compress_zstd`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_utils.md#compress_zstd) compresses data using Facebook's Zstandard algorithm.
- [`utils.decompress_zstd`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_utils.md#decompress_zstd) decompresses data using Facebook's Zstandard algorithm.
- **Debot module**:
    - `init` function that creates an instance of DeBot and returns DeBot metadata.
    - Dengine fetches metadata form DeBot by calling 2 mandatory functions: `getRequiredInterfaces` and `getDebotInfo`. This data is returned by `fetch` and `init` functions.
    - `approve` DeBot Browser callback which is called by DEngine to request permission for DeBot activities.

### Changed
- **Debot Module**:
    - [breaking] `fetch` function does't create an instance of debot. It returns DeBot metadata (`DebotInfo`).
    - [breaking] `start` function does't create an instance of debot. It accepts DeBot handle created in `init` function.

## [1.11.1] – 2021-03-15

### New
- Giver address in tests is calculated from secret key. Default values are provided for TON OS SE giver

## [1.11.0] – 2021-03-05

### New
- [`utils.calc_storage_fee`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_utils.md#calc_storage_fee) function to calculate account storage fee over a some time period.
- **Debot Module**:
    - Added unstable functions to `Sdk` interface: `getAccountsDataByHash`

## [1.10.2] – 2021-03-11

### Fixed
- `index.d.ts` files in `lib-` packages are refined to be more typed.
- export of the `account.ts` added to `core/index`.

## [1.10.1] – 2021-03-10

### New
- New high-level wrapper [Account.ts](packages/core/src/account.ts) that simplifies work with accounts:
   
  `Account` class is introduced that supports these high-level methods:
    - (static) `giver` - allows to specify a giver to be used in all deploy operations
    - `deploy` - deploys a contract
    - `run` - executes a contract on-chain
    - `runLocal` - executes a contract off-chain (on client side, contract state does not change) (execution is syncronized with the previously called `deploy` or `run` so that it is performed on the updated account state)
    - `getAddress` - returns account address
    - `getAccount`- returns all the data about the account in json format
    - `boc` - returns the account boc.
   
   `GiverContract` object is introduced that is ititialized with [TON OS SE Giver](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-se/tree/master/contracts#giver-v2) address and keys.

## [1.10.0] – 2021-03-04

### New
- Add optional field `src_address` to [`ParamsOfEncodeInternalMessage`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_abi.md#encode_internal_message).
- Field `abi` in [`ParamsOfEncodeInternalMessage`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_abi.md#encode_internal_message) is optional and can be `None` if `call_set` and `deploy_set` are  `None`.
- [`boc.encode_boc`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_boc.md#encode_boc) function provides ability to build and serialize any custom tree of cells.
  Application can use several base Builder serialization primitives like integers, bitstrings
  and nested cells.
- [`boc.get_blockchain_config`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_boc.md#get_blockchain_config) function can extract blockchain configuration from key block and also
from zerostate.
- [`tvm` module](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_tvm.md) functions download current blockchain configuration if `net` is initialized with
DApp Server endpoints. Otherwise [default configuration](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-executor/blob/11f46c416ebf1f145eacfb996587891a0a3cb940/src/blockchain_config.rs#L214) is used.
- **Debot Module**:
    - Support for debot invoking in Debot Engine. `send` browser callback is used not only for interface calls but to invoke debots.
    - `start` and `fetch` functions returns debot ABI.
    - Added new built-in interface `Hex` which implements hexadecimal encoding and decoding.
    - Added unstable functions to `Sdk` interface: naclBox, naclBoxOpen, naclKeypairFromSecret, getAccountCodeHash.

### Changed
- Both `call_set` and `deploy_set` in [`ParamsOfEncodeInternalMessage`](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_abi.md#encode_internal_message) can be omitted. In this case `encode_internal_message` generates internal message with empty body.
- **Debot Module**:
    - `send` function accepts one argument - serialized internal message as string encoded into base64.
### Documentation
- [Debot browser app object](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_debot.md#AppDebotBrowser) and [signing box app object](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_crypto.md#appsigningbox) descriptions added
- functions-helpers for enum type variable creation for [Signer](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_abi.md#signer), [Abi](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_abi.md#abi), [ParamsOfAppDebotBrowser](mod_debot.md#paramsofappdebotbrowser)

### Fixed

-  doc generator: app object interface description, constructor functions-helpers for enum type variable creation, added new line in the end if api.json
- library libsecp256k1 upgraded to fix https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2019-0027

## 1.9.0 Feb 19, 2021

### New

- `tuple_list_as_array` parameter in `tvm.run_get` function which controls lists representation.
Default is stack-like based on nested tuples. If set to `true` then returned lists are encoded as plain arrays.  Use this option if you receive this error on Web: "Runtime error. Unreachable code should not be executed..."
This reduces stack size requirements for long lists.
- `function_name` field of `CallSet` structure can be the name or **id (as string in hex starting with 0x)** of the called function. 
- Fields `config_servers`, `query_url`, `account_address`, `gas_used` added into specific errors' `ClientError.data` object.

### Fixed

- Binaries download links are now under https protocol
- If you receive this error on Web: "Runtime error. Unreachable code should not be executed..." in `run_get`, use the new parameter `tuple_list_as_array = true`. [See the documentation](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_tvm.md#run_get). This may happen, for example, when elector contract contains too many participants

## 1.8.0 Feb 11, 2021

### New

- **Debot Module**:
    - Added new built-in interface `Msg` which allows to send external message to blockchain and sign it with supplied keypair.
    
### Fixed

- `crypto.hdkey_public_from_xprv` used compressed 33-byte form instead of normal 32-byte.

## 1.7.0 Feb 9, 2021
### New
- BOC cache management functions were introduced:
  - `boc.cache_set`, 
  - `boc.cache_get`  
  - `boc.cache_unpin` 
- Now functions that take boc as a parameter can also take a reference to boc cash instead so that it deсreases the number of boc serialization 
and deserializations which drastically improves performance of `run_tvm` and `run_executor` expecially in case of numerous calls on the same data. 
- `boc_cache` parameter in `tvm.run_tvm` and `tvm.run_executor` functions to save resulting messages and account BOCs into cache.
- `return_updated_account` flag parameter introduced in `tvm.run_tvm` and `tvm.run_executor` functions to return updated account state. Important: by default this flag is `false` and account data is not returned.
- `abi.encode_internal_message` function to encode an internal ABI-compatible message.
- **Debot Module**:
    - Support for get-methods and external calls in debots.
    Debots can send external inbound messages to destination contracts (signed - for external calls and unsigned - for get-methods) using native language syntax without actions.
    - Built-in debot interfaces (interfaces implemented by DEngine).
    Added two built-in interfaces: base64 and Sdk.
    - Added `DebotInterfaceExecutor` to automatically route messages to destination interfaces.
    - Debot's `fetch` function is optional now. New debots can implement only `start` function.

## 1.6.3 Feb 4, 2021
### Fixed
- Expired message wasn't retried if local execution succeeded.

## 1.6.0 Jan 29, 2021
### New
- `nacl_sign_detached_verify` function to verify detached signature.
- `aggregate_collection` function as a wrapper for GraphQL aggregation queries.
- `batch_query` function performs multiple queries per single fetch.
- Active endpoint invalidation in case of network error occuring.
- `network.network_retries_count` config parameter is deprecated. `network.max_reconnect_timeout` is introduced that allows to specify maximum network resolving timeout. Default value is 2 mins. 
- `initial_pubkey` field in `DeploySet` to specify public key instead of one from TVC file or provided by signer.
- Support for debot interfaces:
  - `send` Browser Callback to send messages with interface calls to Browser.
  - new variant `ParamsOfAppDebotBrowser::Send`.
  - `send` API function to send messages from Browser to Debot.
  - `run_output.rs` - internal structure RunOutput to filter messages generated by debot to 4 categories: interface calls, external calls, get-method calls and invoke calls.

### Fixed
- Device time synchronization is checked only in `send_message`. Data querying does not require proper time now

## 1.5.3 Jan 14, 2021

### Fixed
