# The recrypt Ed25519 library that we use (https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek) depends on this clear_on_drop
# crate (https://github.com/cesarb/clear_on_drop). That crate, by default, implements code via C to clear memory. That doesn't
# work in WASM. However, they have a feature to turn off requiring C which we're enabling here. This allows our WASM bindings to enable
# this feature without having to change the default for our recrypt-rust crate.
